# Bay-Area-Bike-Share-Python
Gathered Bay Area Bike sharing data and performed time based exploration of bicycle trip data
Analyzed data for frequency variation across time, trips by calendar date, time of the day, day of the week and integrated it with weather data to analyze the impact of weather on trips using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, bookeh, scikit-learn
Integrated the trip data with weather data to analyze how does the weather impact the trip data; predict the number of daily trips by implementing predictive models such as lasso regression, regression decision tree and boosting
